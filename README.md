# Gas consuption forecast
Attempt to use Machine Learning to predict natural gas consumption for domestic needs like heating and cooking.
As a training data I use my historical values. 

*Intentionally written in pure Matlab languge using only basic mathematics operations.*

* Prediction model: polynomial regression
* Optimization algorithm: [normal equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares_(mathematics))
